# Scripts
A collection of AutoHotKey Scripts designed to make adjustments to Windows 11 audio devices.
These scripts require installation of the AutoHotKey software from https://www.autohotkey.com/

Currently there are scripts to do the following:

1) Enable Dolby Atmos for Headphones
2) Adjust audio device speaker configuration to 5.1
3) Adjust audio device speaker configuration to 7.1


Please note:
If you choose to use these scripts you do so at your own risk. 
I am not liable for anything.
